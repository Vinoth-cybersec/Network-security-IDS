Hereâ€™s a sample README file for your Intrusion Detection System (IDS) project:

# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## Overview
This project implements a simple Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Python and Scapy. The IDS captures network packets and detects specific attack patterns based on predefined rules.

## Features
- **Packet Capture**: Monitors network traffic in real time.
- **Signature-Based Detection**: Identifies known attack patterns such as SYN floods and port scans.
- **Alerts**: Generates alerts for detected intrusions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Scapy
- Pandas (optional for future enhancements)

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ids-project.git
   cd ids-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install scapy pandas
   ```

## Usage
1. **Run the IDS**:
   Execute the script with root privileges to capture packets:
   ```bash
   sudo python ids.py
   ```

2. **Monitor Alerts**:
   The system will display captured packets and generate alerts for detected intrusions.

## Known Attack Patterns
The following attacks are currently detected:
- **SYN Flood**: Identified by the presence of SYN packets.
- **Port Scan**: Detected by analyzing ICMP packets.

## Future Enhancements
- **Logging**: Implement logging functionality to record alerts in a file.
- **User Interface**: Create a web interface to visualize network traffic and alerts.
- **Machine Learning**: Integrate machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection.
